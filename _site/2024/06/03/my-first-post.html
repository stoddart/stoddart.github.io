<p>Some of you may know that for the past several years, I’ve been living quietly on an island in the Philippines with my wife and two children. By 2016, I had realised that I was in a rut personally and professionally and had decided a change of scenery was probably in order. Also, since I had been working remotely for a few years before that, I could no longer use a job as an excuse to avoid seeing more of the world. I had already been bitten by the travel bug.  A 2007 trip to Israel to explore the Holy Land, <a href="https://a.co/d/iG7us9w">the history of Byzantium and the Crusades</a>, and ancient sites like <a href="https://a.co/d/j5WFl43">Jerusalem</a>, Akko, Haifa, Tel Megiddo, Jericho, Capernaum, Beersheba, El-Araj, Beit She’an, Tel Hazor, Qumran, and <a href="https://a.co/d/3wRYZkH">Masada</a> had whetted my appetite to go off the beaten path and see parts of the world far away from the usual European tourist haunts.</p>

<p>I was only supposed to be here on the island of Negros for six months, but because of a series of circumstances beyond my control, my brief sojourn turned into what physicist <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-kuhn/">Thomas Kuhn</a> has called a “paradigm shift”. And though my shift wasn’t scientific in nature, it was a social and cultural rearrangement of assumptions I used to hold dear.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:inherit;"><i>Usually the Philippines is pretty sleepy, but occasionally there's some real excitement</i></p>

<h1 id="i-blame-national-geographic">I blame National Geographic</h1>

<p>It all started with a National Geographic magazine subscription that was a childhood gift from my grandparents when I was twelve years old.</p>

<p>Whenever an issue arrived in our rural Pennsylvania mailbox that featured the Philippines, I found myself taking a particular interest in the remote island archipelago. Articles with titles such as <i>The Last Tribes of Mindanao, Sea Gypsies of the Philippines,</i> and <i>Tropical Rainforests: Nature’s Dwindling Treasures</i> fascinated me, firing my young imagination with visions of densely-packed rainforests of palm and banana trees, exotic and endangered animal species, and primitive cultures replete with supposedly noble savages and tribal chieftans.</p>

<p>In fairness, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anthony-Bourdain-No-Reservations-Season/dp/B09229BZ67">Anthony Bourdain</a> must take some of the blame as well.</p>

<p>But in 2007, the idea of travelling to the Philippines, let alone living here, was a ludicrous proposition and something I would never imagine doing at that time. I liked my life in the USA for the most part, and I didn’t see myself relocating to a southeast Asian country on the other side of the planet. I was still working as a land surveyor and commuting to work. Even so, I was reading a lot about the archaeology of Israel, a country rich with ancient history.</p>

<p>I decided to save up my precious comp time and blow it all in one go on a trip to the Holy Land. My employer clearly didn’t want to let me go for that long, but they couldn’t say ‘no’ because I had earned it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:inherit;"><i>It was time for a legit adventure</i></p>

<p>So after a sleepless flight from New York City that I spent reading <a href="https://a.co/d/hUw6sTQ">guidebooks</a>, I landed in Tel-Aviv wide-eyed and beset with a sense of wonder. Little did I know what was in store for me!</p>
